ITU-1 -- Step 4, free/local variant of claude_label.py.

Same grounding verification, same architecture.assemble() call, same
TrainingExample shape as claude_label.py -- but the model-facing contract
here is deliberately DIFFERENT from claude_label.py's, because a 3-8B local
model and Claude are not equally capable of the same task.

Setup (one-time)
-----------------
1. Install Ollama: https://ollama.com/download
2. ollama pull qwen2.5:3b-instruct
   If your 8GB-RAM box has headroom, prefer the q8 build of the SAME
   parameter count over stepping up to a bigger model:
       ollama pull qwen2.5:3b-instruct-q8_0
   Same 3B reasoning ceiling, but q8 keeps far more precision than the
   default q4_K_M quantization -- a free accuracy bump, no prompt/code
   changes, still ~3GB. This is a genuinely different lever from going to
   7B (which this hardware can't safely run -- see the conversation this
   script came out of).
3. `ollama --version` should be >= 0.5 so the JSON-schema-constrained
   output actually engages (auto-falls-back to plain format="json" with a
   warning on older Ollama).

Usage
-----
    python local_label.py \
        --collected data/collected.jsonl \
        --weak-labels data/weak_labels.jsonl \
        --batches data/labeling_batches.jsonl \
        --out data/training_examples.jsonl \
        --spot-check-out data/spot_check_needed.jsonl \
        --rejects-out data/rejected.jsonl \
        --spot-check-rate 0.175 \
        --model qwen2.5:3b-instruct \
        --limit 10

Then drop --limit to run the rest. --resume skips issues already
dispositioned and appends instead of overwriting -- use it for any run long
enough to risk being interrupted.

Design, v0.1 -> v0.6
--------------------
v0.1 asked the model for a JSON array of per-field {value, source,
pointers, evidence_text, confidence} envelopes -- reasonable for Claude,
not for a 3B model, which answers correctly but can't hold that nested
shape in its head.

v0.2 moved grounding out of the model into Python: the model is asked only
for flat field values (schema-constrained so classification fields
literally cannot come back outside their enum), and grounding is computed
deterministically -- locking any classification field the repo's own
GitHub label already answers, keyword-matching literal evidence for
everything else, falling back to an honest INFERRED judgment call only
when nothing literal supports the value.

v0.3 added a few-shot example (in the flat shape actually used), per-field
decision criteria, and an optional scratch "reasoning" field ahead of the
classification fields.

v0.4 added reasoning/answer consistency checking, stratified (risk-
weighted) spot-checking, segment budgeting, and num_predict headroom, plus
opt-in self-consistency voting.

v0.5 added num_ctx (Ollama silently truncates at 2048 tokens otherwise),
dropped unused list fields from the prompt, model-supplied VERIFIED
evidence phrases, surgical re-ask on flagged fields only, opt-in
self-critique, and cluster-based dynamic few-shot + majority check.

v0.6 (this version) -- one real bug fix, found from a live 3-issue test run
on qwen2.5:3b-instruct:

  EXEMPLAR CONTAMINATION. The v0.5 dynamic few-shot (a real, already-
  labeled issue from the same embedding cluster, shown for calibration)
  is topically very close to the issue actually being labeled -- that's
  the whole point of using embedding-cluster similarity to pick it. But a
  live run surfaced a 3B-model failure mode nobody had tested for: on the
  third of three same-cluster prettier/markdown issues, qwen2.5:3b did not
  use the exemplar for calibration -- it COPIED it. The output for issue
  #3 ("[3.9 regression] Markdown: $...$ parsed as inline math...") came
  back with task_type=Feature, role=Fullstack, experience_level=
  Intermediate, complexity=Medium, and a summary/objective that were
  VERBATIM the exemplar's own values (issue #1, "Support directives in MDX
  parser") -- not the actual issue's content at all. Only `title` survived
  correctly, because title is hardcoded from the real segment and never
  trusted from the model (see build_proposals_from_flat). The "for
  calibration only -- this is NOT the issue you're labeling" instruction
  in build_dynamic_worked_example was not enough to stop a 3B model from
  pattern-matching "similar topic -> same answer" once the exemplar pool
  had real entries in it. This is systemic, not a one-off: it gets WORSE
  as more same-cluster examples accumulate, and it was silent -- nothing
  in v0.5 detected or flagged it. That single bad record would have gone
  straight into training_examples.jsonl with only an 18% base spot-check
  chance of ever being looked at by a human.

  Fix, entirely in Python, no extra model calls:
    1. _looks_copied_from_exemplar() compares the model's flat response
       against the dynamic exemplar's task fields after every propose()
       call that used one: near-identical summary/objective/
       expected_outcome text (normalized, high overlap), OR all four
       classification fields matching the exemplar exactly while an
       evidence phrase quotes exemplar-flavored text not present in the
       real segments, counts as a match.
    2. On a match, the call is redone ONCE, immediately, with the dynamic
       few-shot block removed entirely (falling back to only the generic
       static example) -- and a hardened instruction line inserted that
       explicitly names the exemplar's own field values and says not to
       reuse them. This costs one extra model call, but ONLY on an issue
       that actually tripped the check, not on every issue that happens
       to have a cluster exemplar available.
    3. If the retry still matches the exemplar, the issue is written to
       rejected.jsonl instead of training_examples.jsonl (rather than
       silently accepted with a flag) -- a record whose content mirrors
       a different issue is not safe to keep as SILVER-tier training
       data, self-consistency-vote or not.
    4. Every occurrence (matched-on-first-try, fixed-by-retry, or
       rejected) is logged to data/exemplar_contamination_log/
       <collection_id>.json with both the original and (if any) retried
       response, so this can be audited across a full run rather than
       trusted blind.

  This does not change any behavior when no dynamic exemplar was shown
  (cold start, or --no-cluster-few-shot) -- the check is a no-op there,
  same graceful-degradation posture as the rest of the cluster feature.

Reality check on quality
-------------------------
None of this closes the hard ceiling noted from v0.1 onward: complexity
and experience_level have no reliable generic cross-repo signal (see
bootstrap_and_cluster.py's own reasoning for never locking complexity),
so accuracy on those two is bounded by "however good this model's
judgment is," full stop -- these changes raise that ceiling and catch more
of the cases where the model is wrong, they don't remove the ceiling.
verify_grounding() remains the real safety net, and --spot-check-rate
(risk-weighted) is still what tells you your actual error rate on the
unreviewed majority. Two levers deliberately left as non-code
recommendations rather than built here: the q8-quantization swap (just
change --model, see step 2 above) and a LoRA fine-tune on accumulated
spot-check corrections once you have enough of them (train_lora.py
already exists in this repo for that, separately from this script).
